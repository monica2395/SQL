Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:

Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.
events Table:
Column Name	Type
app_id	integer
event_type	string
timestamp	datetime
events Example Input:
app_id	event_type	timestamp
123	impression	07/18/2022 11:36:12
123	impression	07/18/2022 11:37:12
123	click	07/18/2022 11:37:42
234	impression	07/18/2022 14:15:12
234	click	07/18/2022 14:16:12
Example Output:
app_id	ctr
123	50.00
234	100.00
Explanation
Let's consider an example of App 123. This app has a click-through rate (CTR) of 50.00% because out of the 2 impressions it received, it got 1 click.

To calculate the CTR, we divide the number of clicks by the number of impressions, and then multiply the result by 100.0 to express it as a percentage. In this case, 1 divided by 2 equals 0.5, and when multiplied by 100.0, it becomes 50.00%. So, the CTR of App 123 is 50.00%.


Solutions:

1st Method:
with CTR_cte AS(
SELECT
app_id,
count(*) Filter(where event_type='click') as NOC,
count(*) FILTER(where event_type='impression') as NOI
from events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' 
  AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
group by app_id
)
select
app_id,
Round(100.0 * NOC/NOI,2) as ctr
from CTR_cte


2nd Method:
SELECT
  app_id,
  ROUND(100.0 *
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2)  AS ctr_rate
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' 
  AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY app_id;
