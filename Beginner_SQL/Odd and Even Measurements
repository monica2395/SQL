Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.

Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

Definition:

Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.
Effective April 15th, 2023, the question and solution for this question have been revised.

measurements Table:
Column Name	Type
measurement_id	integer
measurement_value	decimal
measurement_time	datetime
measurements Example Input:
measurement_id	measurement_value	measurement_time
131233	1109.51	07/10/2022 09:00:00
135211	1662.74	07/10/2022 11:00:00
523542	1246.24	07/10/2022 13:15:00
143562	1124.50	07/11/2022 15:00:00
346462	1234.14	07/11/2022 16:45:00
Example Output:
measurement_day	odd_sum	even_sum
07/10/2022 00:00:00	2355.75	1662.74
07/11/2022 00:00:00	1124.50	1234.14




Solution 1:

with cte as(
SELECT measurement_id,
measurement_value as val,
cast(measurement_time as Date) as measurement_day,
Dense_Rank()Over(partition by cast(measurement_time as Date) 
order by measurement_time) as RN
FROM measurements)

Select measurement_day,
Sum(Case when RN%2=1 then val else 0 END) as odd_sum,
Sum(Case when RN%2=0 then val else 0 END) as even_sum
from cte
group by measurement_day;
